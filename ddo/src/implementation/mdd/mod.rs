//! This module provides an implementation of the mdd data structure.
//! After this API revamping, I have decided to only include the VectorBased MDD
//! (aka DefaultMDD). But if there is a need, I might decide to bring back the
//! flat and pooled MDD implementations as well in the future.
//!
//! # Note:
//! PooledMDD was the version working best on the Maximum Independent Set Problem
//! (MISP). If this is the problem you want to solve, you might want to stick with
//! a previous version of ddo (<= 0.5.0).
