    ///   is the best value of the objective function that was known at the time
    ///   of cutoff.
    /// * When the `is_exact` flag is true, and no `best_value` is present: it
    ///   means that the problem admits no feasible solution (UNSAT).
    /// * When the `is_exact` flag is false and no `best_value` is present: it
    ///   simply means that no feasible solution has been found before the 
    ///   cutoff occurred.
